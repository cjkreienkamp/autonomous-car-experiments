# Autonomous Car Experiments

This repository encompasses a series of Python scripts dedicated to modeling and simulating various aspects of autonomous vehicle dynamics. The experiments primarily focus on kinematic bicycle models and longitudinal vehicle models, which are fundamental in understanding vehicle behavior and control strategies.

## Repository Structure

The repository contains the following key files:

- **Kinematic_Bicycle_Model_1.py**: Introduces the basic kinematic bicycle model, simulating vehicle motion based on steering and velocity inputs.
- **Kinematic_Bicycle_Model_2.py**: Builds upon the initial model by incorporating additional parameters or control strategies.
- **Kinematic_Bicycle_Model_3.py**: Further refines the kinematic bicycle model, potentially adding complexities such as variable road conditions or advanced control mechanisms.
- **Longitudinal_Vehicle_Model_1.py**: Focuses on the longitudinal dynamics of the vehicle, modeling acceleration and braking behaviors.
- **Longitudinal_Vehicle_Model_2.py**: Enhances the longitudinal model to include more detailed factors affecting vehicle motion, such as aerodynamic drag or drivetrain dynamics.
- **c2_m1_l1.py**, **c2_m1_l2.py**, **c2_m2_l3.py**, **c2_m2_lab.py**: Scripts that correspond to specific lessons within a course on vehicle dynamics and control systems.
- **data.pickle**: A serialized data file, containing datasets used by the models.
